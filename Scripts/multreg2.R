#let's continue with the EDA. lattice is a great graphics library.
#if you have not installed it, type  install.packages("lattice")
#load it in to R each time you start R
library(lattice)

#you also can make these plots with ggplot -- I will post those commands later.

#let's look for interaction effects using trellis plots.  Let's use LogPrice on Carats by each color
xyplot(Logprice~Carats | Color, data = diamonds)

# slope in each plot is similar, so no strong evidence of interaction between Carats and Color 

#repeat for clarity and certification
xyplot(Logprice~Carats | Clarity, data = diamonds)
xyplot(Logprice~Carats | Certification, data = diamonds)

#same result: similar slopes in each panel, so no strong evidence of interactions with Carats 

#we also can examine trellis plots for box plots to see if there are interactions among categoical vars

bwplot(Logprice~Color | Clarity, data = diamonds)

#for any clarity category, the color box plots have a reasonably similar ordering. 
#So, no strong evidence of interaction between Clarity and Color
#repeat for Color and Certification, and Clarity and Certification (we did not do this in class)

#### fitting the multiple regression  ####

### model diagnostics!
#to do checks of residuals versus each predictor, use

#No real patterns, so things look good!

#commands for predicting price of a new diamond, as well as visualing the relationship between price and carats, at end of script.

### coding tip for dummy variables
#a quicker way to let R make the dummy variables uses the as.factor( ) command.

reglogPonAll2 = lm(Logprice~CaratsCent + Carats2 + as.factor(Color) + as.factor(Clarity) + as.factor(Certification), data = diamonds)
summary(reglogPonAll2)

#the quick way is especially useful if you don't care which is the baseline, and in initial stages of model fitting where you are trying
#to find a good model first before worrying about interpretation.

#if you want to control the level with the as.factor way, use the following.
#suppose you want to change the reference category to Color == G.  Then, use
reglogPonAll2 = lm(Logprice~CaratsCent + Carats2 + relevel(as.factor(Color), ref = "G") + as.factor(Clarity) + as.factor(Certification), data = diamonds)

#let's look at the results
summary(reglogPonAll2)


### nested f test to see if a whole set of dummy variables are significant

#let's do a nested F test to see if certification as a whole is important
#first we fit the model without certification

reglogPonAllNocert = lm(Logprice~CaratsCent + Carats2 + colorE + colorF + colorG + colorH + colorI + clarityVS1 + clarityVS2 + clarityVVS1 + clarityVVS2, data = diamonds)
anova(reglogPonAll, reglogPonAllNocert)

#p value is 0.088.  This is borderline evidence.  The organization that certified the diamond may well have an effect on the price, although
#we don't have strong evidence to rule out the possibility that it does not. 


##### Interactions  #####

#use lattice plots to search for possible interaction effects -- see commands at the beginning of script.

#after fitting regression, look for interaction effects in residual plots.
#if you see different patterns in residuals vs. some predictor based on values of another predictor, try an interaction effect in the regression model

#let's look for interactions in the diamonds regression.

xyplot(reglogPonAll$residual~ diamonds$CaratsCent | diamonds$Color)
xyplot(reglogPonAll$residual~ diamonds$CaratsCent | diamonds$Clarity)
xyplot(reglogPonAll$residual~ diamonds$CaratsCent | diamonds$Certification)

#not much. maybe we can try the interaction of Carats with Clarity.

##fitting interaction effects:  two ways
#the quick way is to add a * between the two variables that you want to interact

reglogPonAllInt = lm(Logprice ~ CaratsCent*as.factor(Clarity) + Carats2*as.factor(Clarity) + as.factor(Color) + as.factor(Certification), data = diamonds)

#a more concise way to write this is:  reglogPonAllInt = lm(Logprice ~ (CaratsCent + Carats2)*as.factor(Clarity) + as.factor(Color) + as.factor(Certification), data = diamonds)

#the long way to include an interaction is to create a new variable equal to the product of the two variables you want to interact.  then include it in the regression.
#when interacting with a categorical variable, create interaction variables for all levels of the categorical variables (except the baseline)

#let's look at the results
summary(reglogPonAll2)

#see the R script called "interactions.txt" for interpretations of these results.

#let's do a nested F test to see if the entire set of interactions is useful (this test is also on the interactions.txt script)

anova(reglogPonAll, reglogPonAllInt)

#Set of interactions appears to be a useful predictor. However, we note that the interaction coefficients only are 
#significant for VS2, which confirms what we saw in the xyplot for the residuals.  I don't know of any reason why 
#the relationship of carats should differ for VS2 diamonds but not others.  So, I am skeptical whether or not this
#set of interactions is "too specific" to these particular diamonds.  That is, it is helping with the fit of these particular prices 
#but might not be significant if we had another set of data.  We'd want some expert advice to decide whether or not to believe this interaction effect
#is practically meaningful.


####  plot for visualizing relationship of carats with logprice
#make several values of carat deviations from the average
caratchanges = seq(from = -.5, to = .5, by = .05)

#compute the value of B1*caratchanges + B2*caratchanges^2

#list the coefficients
coef(reglogPonAll)

#we take the second and third values of the coefficient vector to get B1 and B2
avglogp = coef(reglogPonAll)[2]*caratchanges + coef(reglogPonAll)[3]*caratchanges^2

#plot them on the log scale
plot(y = avglogp, x = caratchanges, xlab = "Change in Carats", ylab = "Change in average log price")

#not especially interpretable, so transform to percent change in medians (recall the interpretation of logs and medians)
plot(y = exp(avglogp), x = caratchanges, xlab = "Change in Carats", ylab = "Percent change in median price")


#### predicting a new  diamond price


#how about making a prediction for a new diamond with 1 carat, color g, clarity vvs2, and GIA certification?
#we need a new dataset with the same format as the diamonds data.  So, let's copy one row of diamond to initialize our new dataset

newdata = diamonds[1,]

#now we replace each value, ignoring anything to do with price or logprice since we won't use those in the prediction.

#start by replacing the value of carats. Since we have only one row as prediction
newdata$Carats[1] = 1 

#now to Color
newdata$Color[1] = "G" 

#Clarity
newdata$Clarity[1] = "VVS2" 

#Certification
newdata$Certification[1] = "GIA" 

#ignore columns 5 and 6, which deal with price and logprice.

#Caratscentered
newdata$CaratsCent[1] = newdata$Carats[1] - mean(diamonds$Carats) 

#carats centered squared
newdata$Carats2[1] = newdata$CaratsCent[1]^2 

#zero out the indicators for all colors but D
newdata$colorD[1] = 0

newdata$colorF[1] = 0
newdata$colorG[1] = 1
